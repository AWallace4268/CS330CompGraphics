# CS330CompGraphics
This is my portfolio submission for CS330 Computer Visual Graphics class. In this repository I will be submitting my final project.

How do I approach designing software?
When it comes to designing software the first thing I look into is what am I designing? From there I make some UML diagrams and decide what I should work on first.
The creation of the diagrams allows me to see what exactly I need to work on first in order to combine all other parts of the software to get it working. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This course allowed me to create 3D scenes. I have never touched graphics until this class, and I was super excited to finally be able to make graphics.
This class was also the most coding intensive class that I have had so far. Allowing me to see how a full project is created and how much time I actually
need when creating projects.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process I followed was KISS. Keep It Simple, Stupid. At times I found myself overwhelmed with the work load. Therefore when creating my final project
I tried to KISS it by making the scene easier for me.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
In the future KISS can help me by allowing me to not overthink the overall idea of the project. Keep the code simple, and if I need to make any
drastic changes... I can simply add to the simple code rather than trying to make a huge fancy code line from the beginning.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by trying to see the overall picture. What am I trying to accomplish? What initial steps can I take to get the project going?
What parts of the project will take the most amount of time to focus on? What parts of the project can I simply copy by using the same mechanics, but maybe different wording?

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I still need to fully grasp the understanding of the Header files. This will ultimately allow me to achieve bigger results in future projects. I was really excited to learn
about lighting and texturing, but I got quite confused. Sitting down after my school and doing some side work on my own personal projects will allow me to understand the concept 
a lot better.

How did iteration factor into your development?
The cool thing about this class is that we worked on our project the entirety of the class. We started with an assignment that allowed us to understand what we were doing that week.
We then took what we learned that week and implemented it into our project the same week. Therefore, when we rendered a shape in week 3's assignment, we also rendered a shape in week 3
for our final project. When we rendered textures and lighting in our assignments. In the corresponding week we also applied it to our final. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Being able to identify what I needed to do and what code I can reuse for other projects was a big deal for me. My coding went from scattered to more understanding of what exactly I was
looking at. For instance when I expressed I needed to get more understanding of the header files. I can identify where I needed to implement my code into the header file, but I was still
unsure how to implement it. I was struggling getting the header and the .ccp files to point at each other.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science can help me reach my goal by allowing me to focus on what I want to work on as an individual. Learning to code has shown me there are countless of 
opportunities waiting for me. Being able to add 3D scenes to my code boosts my confidence in game creation if I was to go that route. However, the overall idea of
computer science has increased my understanding of not just how computers work, but the mathematics behind it as well.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Being able to render graphics and visualizations is a whole new skill to add to my toolbar. Being able to understand how to render in the graphics and apply them to the shapes,
as well as rendering light to scenes was where I was more ecstatic to learn. Though, in my opinion the hardest part of the assignment. Applying them to my education pathway will allow me
to develop better looking applications and draw in my audicence more than just with colors and text.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
As stated above, it allows me to draw in my audience by having a more creative application. I know that when I start my Full Stack Development 1 and 2. I will need to design a website.
Maybe I can implement my findings in this class to give my website a more up to date look!
